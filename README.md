# The Grand Unified Guide to Fully-Automated Luxury Space Communism
This is basically a guide on how to make a perfect society with technology.



# Section 1: Overview
## Section 1.1: What is Fully-Automated Luxury Space Communism?
Let's break this down into its component parts.
- Fully-Automated: Robots will complete every menial task, including manufacturing, physical labor, custodial work, and any other form of labor that is not desirable for a human to perform. Robots to build houses, robots to cook food, robots to harvest resources, robots for everything.
- Luxury: The automation of labor will push humanity to a post-scarcity state, allowing everyone to live a life of luxury. Energy will be generated with thorium reactors, rarer resources will be mined from asteroids or other planets (but we are getting ahead of ourselves), or ideally their use will be minimalized and replaced with a more renewable approach. Due to the automation of labor and the elimination of scarcity, currency will become useless, everyone will be elevated to the same height of luxury, living life as they please.
- Space: As mentioned in the previous paragraph, we will need to go to space. The reasoning for this is two-fold. First, certain resources are simply not abundant enough on our own planet. Second, one of those resources will eventually be space. A planet can only hold so many people, so we must venture into the void and separate outselves from our earthly bond. Perhaps we will terraform Mars and eventually reach further.
- Communism: There would be no need for currency. Everything you need would be provided for you. You would be free to pursue your passions in life. Language, travel, arts, sciences, whatever you want. Being freed from the chains of your labor, you will be free to flourish as an individual without the weight of working stopping you from following your heart and mind. There will be no class, there will be no money, there will be no suffering.

## Section 1.2: Why Fully-Automated Luxury Space Communism?
Because it is the societal organization that will maximize the freedom of individuals and reduce suffering the most. We have the technology and we are creating more every day, we should use it to help the masses rather than to line the pockets of the CEOs and the overlord minority. Figureheads don't create technological advancements, their devteams do. It is time for the technology made by the people to start serving the people.

## Section 1.3: How to Fully-Automated Luxury Space Communism?
Now I know that section 1.1 sounds pretty far fetched, that is because it is. This is only one of many paths that humanity can take as we advance out civilizations. This route will not be easy, it will take *a lot* of work from *a lot* of very smart people. This guide is simply a framework to follow to reach this state. The rest of this question, and more, will be answered in the rest of this guide.
