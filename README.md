# Section 0: Author's Preface
Hello, I am JT Raber. I am currently working towards a B.Sc. of Computer Science with a concentration in Robotics and Embedded Systems and a minor in Mathematics. For years I have been thinking about a societal structure that can utilize technology to the advantage of the people. I think it would be a good idea to really flesh out the ideas with a Github repository, not only because it is public for everyone to read, but because it is also open for community contributions. The first few words of the title (Grand and Unified) are good indicators of how complicated this guide will be, both to write and to carry out. If you want to contribute to the guide, please feel free to make a revision and submit a request. This guide is supposed to be for the people, it should also be made by the people. With the preface out of the way, let's begin the guide.

# Section 1: Overview
## Section 1.1: What is Fully-Automated Luxury Space Communism?
Let's break this down into its component parts.
- Fully-Automated: Robots will complete every menial task, including manufacturing, physical labor, custodial work, and any other form of labor that is not desirable for a human to perform. Robots to build houses, robots to cook food, robots to harvest resources, robots for everything.
- Luxury: The automation of labor will push humanity to a post-scarcity state, allowing everyone to live a life of luxury. Energy will be generated with thorium reactors, rarer resources will be mined from asteroids or other planets (but we are getting ahead of ourselves), or ideally their use will be minimalized and replaced with a more renewable approach. Due to the automation of labor and the elimination of scarcity, currency will become useless, everyone will be elevated to the same height of luxury, living life as they please.
- Space: As mentioned in the previous paragraph, we will need to go to space. The reasoning for this is two-fold. First, certain resources are simply not abundant enough on our own planet. Second, one of those resources will eventually be space. A planet can only hold so many people, so we must venture into the void and separate outselves from our earthly bond. Perhaps we will terraform Mars and eventually reach further.
- Communism: There would be no need for currency. Everything you need would be provided for you. You would be free to pursue your passions in life. Language, travel, arts, sciences, whatever you want. Being freed from the chains of your labor, you will be free to flourish as an individual without the weight of working stopping you from following your heart and mind. There will be no class, there will be no money, there will be no suffering.

## Section 1.2: Why Fully-Automated Luxury Space Communism?
Because it is the societal organization that will maximize the freedom of individuals and reduce suffering the most. We have the technology and we are creating more every day, we should use it to help the masses rather than to line the pockets of the CEOs and the overlord minority. Figureheads don't create technological advancements, their devteams do. It is time for the technology made by the people to start serving the people.

## Section 1.3: How to Fully-Automated Luxury Space Communism?
Now I know that section 1.1 sounds pretty far fetched, that is because it is. This is only one of many paths that humanity can take as we advance out civilizations. This route will not be easy, it will take *a lot* of work from *a lot* of very smart people. This guide is simply a framework to follow to reach this state. The rest of this question, and more, will be answered in the rest of this guide.

# Section 2: Let's Get Into Specifics
Alright, here is where the meat of the guide begins. We will talk about a lot of things, so let's begin with some basics.

## Section 2.1: Energy
We will begin with energy, without which nothing can be done. There are many sources of energy, but none are as dense and plentiful as [thorium](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/thorium.aspx#:~:text=Nature%20and%20sources%20of%20thorium,times%20more%20abundant%20than%20uranium.). Certainly hydrogen, solar, and wind are renewable, but they are not as energy rich as thorium. We must move away from resources such as coal, natural gas, and others that are inefficient and harmful to the earth. Let's go over a few quick points about thorium.

- It is estimated that there are 6,355,000 tonnes of thorium. It is more abundant that uranium in nature.
- Thorium is not fissile, but rather it is fertile. This means that it cannot cause a meltdown like uranium. Thorium needs a catalyst element to begin a reaction, and will stop reacting once the catalyst is removed. The coefficient of reactivity is negative.
- 1 tonne of thorium has the same amount of energy as 200 tonnes of uranium or 3,500,000 tonnes of coal.
- There is up to two magnitudes less of nuclear waste from thorium in a liquid fluoride reactor than from uranium.
- Thorium production does not produce carbon dioxide.
- Earth's thorium supply will last [at least 10,000 years](https://prospect.org/article/will-thorium-save-us-all/#:~:text=One%20ton%20of%20thorium%20can,for%20at%20least%2010%2C000%20years.).

These are six of the benefits of thorium. Basically, if you can get it working well you will be have a safe, clean, practically unlimited energy supply. We need a very strong base so that we can develop the rest of our society without worry about energy.

## Section 2.2: Materials
### Section 2.2.1: Farming
I don't want to say this, but I think that factory farming should be put to an end. I am not exaclty very knowledgeable on this topic, so this is somewhere that the wisdom of the crowd could come in. Basically, from what I have heard it is not a good life for the animals, we are getting pretty good at making fake meat, and farming animals takes a lot of space. Alright, with that out of the way, let's talk about my alternative.
**Farming Skyscraper/Groundchamber**
Alright, so this is pretty much the same thing people do in cities. When expanding outward moves you too far from the epicenter of your city, you build *up* (or down?)! Utilizing the third dimension, one square mile of farmland can be transformed into one *hundred* square miles of farmland. These agricultural structures will serve as large scale greenhouses, featuring irrigation, climate, and lighting systems. I am no farmer, but I am guessing that we can create dirt (I think I saw some article on creating dirt from scratch) and grow stuff like corn, beans, carrots, potatoes, and other types of food that grows in the ground.
